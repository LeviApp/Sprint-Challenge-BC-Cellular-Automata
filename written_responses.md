1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

    In order for a block to be added to a blockchain, several things must fall into place. 

    The first is the functionality itself. A function to solve a certain problem must be implemented. The solution usually involves hashing a value from the last block, and checking that hash value to see if it matches the requirements. Additionally, a function to validate the solution must be used on the user's end.

    The second thing to consider is whether a user solves a problem first. The only time somebody can add a block to the blockchain is if the solution was found first. Additionally, other users have the ability to test your solution to make sure it is a legit solution. If there is 50% consensus that confirm a correct solution, the user who solved it first gets rewarded with it. If a solution has been gathered by cheating in some way, the other users will know this, and the block will be denied.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

   Individuals who mine coins usually have many computer resources. These resources could be the speed of a computer or the number of computers that are used. Using these resources are important. This is because solving problems with the proof of work function is not easy.
   
   To be successful at mining requires patience, time, and a good amount of computer resources. Mining successfully means the server being used has cracked the given problem before anyone else has. In order to verify a successful mine, both the user and other users must use a verify_proof function to check if it is correct. This double checking will stop most hacking and manipulation for selfish gain. Once the tests pass and there is 50% or more consensus, the miner is rewarded a block with a transaction reward. If the checks are not passed, either the solution has been forged or someone else has beat you to the solution.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

    Simulations could be very useful for teaching different scenarios. One scenario could involve the understanding of traffic. What is the best way to set up traffic lights to best limit accidents? 

    Another scenario could be the training of soldiers, firemen, or police. What kind of situations would be best to save the most lives? Using simulations would prevent disasters, even life-threatening disasters, in the real world. It helps individuals see what could happen, and how to address those problems if they do arise.

    Beyond the serious life scenarios, these simulations have been used as entertainment. These simulations bring interesting challenges that can be a part of many different kind of games.
